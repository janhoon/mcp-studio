# Project Brief: MCP Studio

## Project Overview
MCP Studio is a web-based tool for interacting with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing AI conversations while leveraging MCP servers for enhanced capabilities.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Goals
1. **MCP Server Integration**: Enable users to connect and interact with MCP servers
2. **Chat Interface**: Provide an intuitive chat interface for AI conversations
3. **Multi-Provider Support**: Support multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
4. **Persistent Storage**: Store chat history, API keys, and server configurations locally
5. **Real-time Communication**: Enable real-time chat interactions with AI models

### Key Features
- **Chat Management**: Create, rename, delete, and organize chat sessions
- **API Key Management**: Securely store and manage API keys for different providers
- **MCP Server Configuration**: Add, configure, and manage MCP servers
- **Message History**: Persistent storage of all chat messages
- **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop and mobile devices

### Technical Constraints
- **Client-side Storage**: Uses IndexedDB via Dexie for local data persistence
- **No Backend**: Fully client-side application deployed on Cloudflare
- **Modern Web Standards**: Built with Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Security**: API keys stored locally, no server-side data transmission

## Success Criteria
1. Users can successfully connect to MCP servers
2. Chat interface is responsive and intuitive
3. Data persists across browser sessions
4. Multiple AI providers work seamlessly
5. Application loads quickly and performs well

## Out of Scope
- Server-side data storage
- User authentication/accounts
- Real-time collaboration
- Mobile native applications
- Advanced MCP server development tools

## Target Users
- Developers working with MCP servers
- AI enthusiasts exploring different models
- Users wanting a unified interface for multiple AI providers
- Teams needing local AI chat tools without cloud dependencies
