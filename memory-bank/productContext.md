# Product Context: MCP Studio

## Problem Statement
Developers and AI enthusiasts need a unified interface to interact with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and multiple AI providers without relying on cloud-based solutions or complex server setups.

## Why This Project Exists

### Current Pain Points
1. **Fragmented Tools**: Different interfaces for different AI providers
2. **MCP Complexity**: MCP servers require technical setup and command-line interaction
3. **Privacy Concerns**: Cloud-based tools may not meet privacy requirements
4. **Development Friction**: Switching between tools disrupts workflow
5. **Local Storage**: Need for persistent chat history without cloud dependencies

### Market Gap
- No unified web interface for MCP server interaction
- Limited client-side AI chat tools with full data control
- Lack of multi-provider support in single applications
- Missing developer-friendly MCP integration tools

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow
1. **Setup**: User adds API keys for their preferred AI providers
2. **Configuration**: User configures MCP servers (optional)
3. **Chat Creation**: User creates new chat sessions
4. **Conversation**: User interacts with AI through clean chat interface
5. **Management**: User organizes chats, switches providers, manages settings

### Core Interactions
- **Seamless Provider Switching**: Change AI provider mid-conversation
- **MCP Integration**: Leverage MCP server capabilities transparently
- **Persistent History**: All conversations saved locally
- **Quick Access**: Fast loading and responsive interface
- **Privacy First**: No data leaves user's device

## User Experience Goals

### Primary UX Principles
1. **Simplicity**: Clean, uncluttered interface
2. **Speed**: Fast loading and responsive interactions
3. **Reliability**: Consistent performance across sessions
4. **Privacy**: Clear data handling and local storage
5. **Flexibility**: Support for various use cases and workflows

### User Journey Optimization
- **First-time Setup**: Guided onboarding for API keys and MCP servers
